                Return of the Champions is a double live album by English rock band
                Queen + Paul Rodgers. It was recorded in May 2005 during the Queen +
                Paul Rodgers Tour at the Hallam FM Arena in Sheffield, England
                (except for "Imagine", which was performed in Hyde Park, London immediately
                after that year's terrorist attack) and released on 19 September 2005.
                A companion DVD was released in October, directed by David Mallet.
